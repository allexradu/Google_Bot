Google Bot for eCommerce

This bot allows you to quickly download product images from your online shop using Google Image Search.

All you need is a Excel Spreadsheet
 
Step 1. Put your products name in column 1 and name it "Name"

Step 2. Save your workbook as "a.xls" and place it in the same folder you have this software

Step 3. Execute this software using "python google_bot.py"

Step 4. Add the delay between in seconds using a number that can, optionally, include a decimal point [1 recommended]

Step 5. The bot with download 4 images with the file name stating with A1001.jpg (for the first image of the first product), A1002.jpg (for the second image), A1003.jpg (for the third), A1004.jpg (for the forth).

Note: some images might not be in the JPEG format even though they have the suffix .jpg, we recommend converting all images with a batch converter just in case.
